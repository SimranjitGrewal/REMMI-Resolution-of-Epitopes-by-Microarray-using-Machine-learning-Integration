Welcome to R.E.M.M.M.I. or Region-focused Epitope Mapping using Microarrays and Machine-learning Integration

In this repository, you can find all Alphafold generated structures, Array data AT 10ug/mL, and Code employed in the validation and testing of the R.E.M.M.M.I framework

For S4PRED predicted secondary structures, all values are presented as a sum up to 1. Values 'H','C','B' represent alpha-helix, coil, and beta-sheet respectively
